Todo:

1. Request an upgrade of the ok64y-uiaaa-aaaag-qdcbq-cai to this canister. You'll need to build it and then make a dapp upgrade request.  Apparently quill has a toll to make this eaisier?  Maybe blast can do it? https://github.com/dfinity/quill/blob/master/docs/cli-reference/sns/quill-sns-make-upgrade-canister-proposal.mdx

3. Once approved and deployed, request the following generic function be created:
